										<h3> Profile </h3> <br>
									</header>
									
									<p> As a graduate of Santa Clara University with a BS in Web Design and Engineering, I am strongly interested in creating customer-centric products and experiences that combine technology and good design. 
										I developed project management and front-end development skills through various internships, research assistantships, and campus events. </p>

									<p> As part of the Disney College Program, one of my most memorable experiences was working as an Attraction Operations cast member at Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge Rise of the Resistance in Walt Disney World. 
										I learned a lot from working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment and gained valuable insights into how Disney creates immersive and engaging guest experiences. </p>

									<p> I am passionate about community service and using design and tech to aid people worldwide. I have volunteered as a student mentor for the TRIO Upward Bound Program, where I helped high school students from low-income and first-generation backgrounds to pursue higher education. </p>

									<p> I am seeking to leverage my leadership abilities and engineering background to join a full-time project management or user experience position where I can contribute to developing innovative and impactful solutions. 
										I am eager to learn from and collaborate with diverse and talented teams and to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
									
									<p> Below is a quick list of a few of my skills: </p>
